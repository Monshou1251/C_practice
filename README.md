# C Practice Code Samples

## Introduction

This repository contains my practice code samples in C. It's a collection of various small projects and snippets that I've created to hone my C programming skills. These samples cover a range of topics and are intended for educational purposes.

## Contents

This repository is organized by various C projects and practice files. Here's a detailed overview of the contents:

- `collatz` - Contains a solution for the Collatz conjecture problem.
  - `collatz.c`

- `factorial` - A program to calculate the factorial of a number.
  - `factorial.c`

- `search` - Sample code demonstrating search algorithms.
  - `search.c`

- `credit` - A solution for validating credit card numbers using Luhn's algorithm.
  - `credit.c`

- `mario-more` - Advanced solution for creating a pyramid pattern similar to the Mario game's structure.
  - `mario.c`

- `plurality` - Code for a plurality voting system simulation.
  - `plurality.c`

- `population` - A growth simulation of a population over time.
  - `population.c`

- `readability` - A program that computes the Coleman-Liau index of text provided by the user to determine its reading level.
  - `readability.c`

- `runoff` - Implementation of a runoff voting system.
  - `runoff.c`

- `scrabble` - A Scrabble game scorer program.
  - `scrabble.c`

- `sort` - Different sorting algorithms implemented in C.
  - (List of .c files related to sorting)

- `substitution` - A program that implements a substitution cipher.
  - `substitution.c`

Each folder contains source code files related to the project or concept indicated by the folder name. To compile and run any specific program, navigate to its directory and use the C compiler as described in the "Getting Started" section.


## Getting Started

To get started with these samples, clone the repository and navigate into the directory of the sample you're interested in. Most samples can be compiled using a C compiler like `gcc` or `clang`.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/Monshou1251/C_practice)
